i got the concept of users and players tbl :
apart from  all other tables lets analys these thre tables first 
so on goals tbl lets start assume a user created a daily goal:
fields are as i gave the code the user shld chose from the inbuild in db type if fitness/spiritual/learning/coding then chose from inbuilt (dificulty){difficulty shld already be in db containing the color of text 'hard[text-red-500],medium[text-orange-400],easy[text-green-400]  it shld come with for the goal component also with xp if task is difficulty 'hard[350xp],medium[150xp],easy[50xp]} then chose icon of the goal also bgtheme as 'hard[bg-orange-500],medium[bg-purple-500],easy[bg-green-500]} then chose timeframe if its daily or weekly or monthly then data shld be inserted in db with status pending upon completion it shld read as completed then goal is stored as it shld be in time frame how can i implement this table 

///////////////////////
okay so far we are in the right track so add on this :
i need us to ask user idk how but query him before starting he shld specify his journey goal if he will use our app for 3months / 6/ or 1yr so that we can reference with our db to find the total progress so as we can showcase to our dashboard. 
NOTE : the total progress is not the goal progress:
so a user asuming chose 3 months we shld calculate and provide a base figure for the 3 months /6/12 which we will calculate with the total current xp and show %progess
